# Dogfighting Rules
Dogfighting rules are optional rules that change the scale and scope of Grimdark Warfleets to a smaller, squadron style, dogfighting, skirmish. These rules seek to emulate the feel and fun of other dogfighting games such as X-Wing or Aeronautica Imperialis, while still feeling like Grimdark (and importantly using the [OPR's Army Forge](https://army-forge.onepagerules.com/)).

These rules adjust the scale of traditional Grimdark Warfleets, where large, medium, and light ships are all now still "fighter sized". These aren't the hulking capital ships of traditional Grimdark Warfleets, and under these rules even a 'large' ship is at best something like the Millennium Falcon or other relatively small frigate. 
## Squadrons Removed
Squadrons are removed from the game (not used). Any systems, weapons, titles, or heroes that affect squadrons shouldnâ€™t be used. 
## Weapons and Systems Points Cost
Players build their dogfighting fleets using light, medium, and heavy ships (outfitted with weapons, systems, titles or heroes, as per standard rules). However, because squadrons are not used under these rules, **systems and weapons added to ships now cost 5 points per system/weapon added to each ship.** 

If a player chooses to not outfit a ship with full weapons or systems, they may do so, however the ship should still have a full complement of damage boxes as though the ship were fully outfitted. 

Dogfighting fleet point totals should start at 150 points, and points are added together per standard game rules (or via [OPR's Army Forge](https://army-forge.onepagerules.com/)), however **players must manually add the 5 points per weapon/system added to each ship (since the Army Forge doesn't take that into account).** 

If you want a bigger dogfight, just increase beyond the 150 points allowed!
## Turret Changes
Under these rules, the default turret for each ship is changed to be ***front facing arc only***. All other weapon system arcs remain unchanged. 
## Combined Rules
Dogfighting rules work fine on their own, but they are improved if used along with [Template Movement Rules](template-movement-rules.md). For added fun, also try using the Ordinance Rules too!

## FAQ
- **Question:** These rules seem limited, what gives?
	- **Answer:** The dogfighting rules were actually designed to be played WITH the [Template Movement Rules](template-movement-rules.md) for a much closer to X-Wing experience. But rather than putting all of that content into a single rules page, it was split into two complementary rulesets. Using both together is actually how they were designed!

- **Question:** I built a list in Army Forge and a few of my ships don't have any additional weapons or systems, where do I mark damage when they take hits?
	- **Answer:** Since Army Forge isn't setup for Dogfighting Rules, I just print out the Army Forge sheets and then draw boxes manually. It works pretty well. 

- **Question:** Can I take anti-squadron weapons to get their benefit against all ships under these rules?
	- **Answer:** No, anything that refers to "squadrons" should be ignored since they are removed from the game under these rules.
